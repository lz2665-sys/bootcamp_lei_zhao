# Financial Product Analysis
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
Investors often struggle to make timely decisions due to the high volume of market data and complex product structures. This project aims to analyze historical and high-frequency data for a selected financial product to provide actionable insights, helping stakeholders optimize investment decisions and manage risk.

## Stakeholder & User
Primary stakeholders are portfolio managers and risk analysts who make decisions on product allocation. Users include data analysts preparing summaries and visualizations. The workflow involves daily data ingestion, automated analysis scripts, and weekly reporting.

## Useful Answer & Decision
The project will deliver descriptive metrics (e.g., volatility, return distributions), predictive models for short-term price movements, and visual dashboards highlighting key trends. Artifacts include Python notebooks in `/notebooks/` and summary slides or memos in `/docs/`.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Historical and intraday data is available for analysis.
- Analysis will be conducted within Python environment; computational resources are sufficient for dataset sizes.
- Models must run with low latency to provide timely insights.
- Compliance with internal data policies is required.
- External API calls may be rate-limited.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Accuracy of predictive models may vary due to market volatility.
- Missing or delayed data could impact results.
- Model assumptions may not hold in extreme market conditions.
- Risk of misinterpretation of outputs by non-technical stakeholders.

## Lifecycle Mapping
Goal → Stage → Deliverable
- Optimize investment decisions → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → Initial README & folder structure
- Provide actionable insights → Data Analysis & Modeling (Stage 02) → Python notebooks and visualizations
- Share findings with stakeholders → Communication (Stage 03) → Slide deck or memo

## Repo Plan
- `/data/` – raw and processed datasets
- `/src/` – Python scripts and utility functions
- `/notebooks/` – exploratory notebooks and analyses
- `/docs/` – stakeholder memos, slides, and README
- Cadence for updates: weekly commits reflecting analysis progress and documentation
